*** Description:

The included source codes are from a shipping platform: https://www.yepship.com, which was solely designed and
developed by me(Tony Peng) on both back-end and front-end, in 06/2018 (after I resigned from ADP and before I joined Honda/IBM), as a side project 
for shipping company "Yepship". You can visit this platform (https://www.yepship.com), and you will see
"This shipping platform was solely designed and developed by Tony Peng, 06/2018" at the bottom of home page.
Also, feel free to register an account and then try the various functionalities and flows of this platform.

This shipping platform essentially integrated with third-party shipping API to provide various shipping services
to customers, such as checking shipping rates, generating FedEx and UPS shipping labels, online payments, and etc.


*** Technologies Stack ***

I designed and developed this shipping platform with the following technologies stack on back-end and front-end, respectively:


  (1) Back-end:

   Back-end was build and implemented with Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Rest Services, 
   JWT token, Hibernate, Jersey client, maven, and other frameworks/tools. Feel free to browser source codes to see how all those
    get configured, designed, and work properly.
   

   (2) Front-end:

   Front-end was designed and developed by React, Redux, Material Design, Ant Design, React Router, Webpack, and a few more UI 
   libraries and tools. 


** Please note: As the position I am applying for is "Senior Java developer position", only back-end is included in sharing, front-end source codes 
are not included.
